# Streaming_Ingestion_Pipeline
Step-by-Step Streaming Ingestion Pipeline building for Snowflake with AWS
I will use services in AWS to facilitate a streaming pipeline that will land data in Snowflake in near real time. 
Snowflake is the leading modern cloud-based data platform in the industry today.
Architecturally, Snowflake enables data engineers to build Lakehouse environments, a combination of a data warehouse and data lake due to its ability to support both structured and semi-structured data. 
As Snowflake is based in the cloud, it offers elasticity and scalability without worrying about things like high upfront costs, performance, or complexity of managing the system. 
AWS is a secure cloud services platform offering compute power, database storage, 360 degree tooling for your software development lifecycle and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow.
